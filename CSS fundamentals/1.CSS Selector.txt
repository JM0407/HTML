1.CSS selector
	a. you can select an element you want to modify in css by calling it inside <style></style>
		ex: lets call p element and change its color to red
			<html>
			<head>
				<style>
					p {
  						color: red;
					}
				</style>
			</head>
			<body>

				<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

			</body>
			</html>

	b. to call id use # selector
		ex: Change the color of the element with id="para1", to "red".
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>
			<head>
				<style>
					#para1 {
 						 color: red;
						}
				</style>
			</head>
			<body>

				<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
				<p id="para1">This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

			</body>
			</html>
	c. to call class use . selector
		ex: Change the color of all elements with the class "colortext", to "red".
			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>
			<head>
				<style>
					.colortext {
  						color: red;
					}
				</style>
			</head>
			<body>

				<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p class="colortext">This is another paragraph.</p>
				<p class="colortext">This is also a paragraph.</p>

			</body>
			</html>
    
    d. We can also group selectors
        ex: Change the color of all <p> and <h1> elements, to "red". Group the selectors to minimize code.
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <style>
                    h1, p {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </style>
            </head>
            <body>

                <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                <h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

            </body>
            </html>
